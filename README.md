# Wiki

This is my design and implementation of Project 1 (Wiki) in Harvard’s CS50 Web Programming With Python and Javascript 2020 course.

Wiki is a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia that consists of a number of encyclopedia entries on various topics.
This project 

Instead of each entry being written in HTML, this project utilize Markdown for storing encyclopedia in a lighter-weight human-friendly markup language.

Other than mandatory requirements, I wrote my own Markdown to HTML conversion function without using any external libraries. In the process I have learnt a lot about Regular Expression.
