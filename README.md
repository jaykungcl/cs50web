# Search

This is my design and implementation of Project 0 (Search) in Harvardâ€™s CS50 Web Programming With Python and Javascript 2020 course.

In this project, I designed a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search by mirroring from official Google website (reference from google search page around 10/2021). I have learned about HTML element and styling by basic CSS which is very valuable.
