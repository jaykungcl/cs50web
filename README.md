# Mail

This is my design and implementation of Project 3 (Mail) in Harvardâ€™s CS50 Web Programming With Python and Javascript 2020 course.

Mail is email client that users can signup, login, send mails, receive mails, archive/unarchive, and reply to mails.
 In this project I implements all the functionality (front-end) using APIs provided by the  CS50 Web team. In working on this project, I got to practice on a principal of built-in fetch request, how to make request to specific endpoints, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.
