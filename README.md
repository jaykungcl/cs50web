# Commerce


This is my design and implementation of Project 2 (Commerce) in Harvard’s CS50 Web Programming With Python and Javascript 2020 course.

Commerce is an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist”. This project was built using HTML, Bootstrap, and Django.

1. Download this code either by using git clone or direct download
