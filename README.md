# Network

This is my design and implementation of Project 4 (Network) in Harvardâ€™s CS50 Web Programming With Python and Javascript 2020 course.

Network is a twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users. This application was built using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Django.

There are many challenging tasks I encountered during the time I worked on the project; buidling my very first RESTful APIs, discovered ways of implementing pagination with JavaScript (Not an instant plug-in) and many more!

Additional function that I have implemented (other than specification in requirements) was deleting post, add profile picture, edit profile, history/url state push and mobile responsive!
